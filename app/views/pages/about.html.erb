      The Story Behind Aji Tracker
    </h1>

    <p class="mx-auto text-lg text-center text-gray-400 lg:text-2xl lg:text-left md:text-sm">
      This app was inspired by my first cat, Aji, a ginger and white furball with a surprisingly particular taste. Unlike most ginger cats, Aji has his own unique preferences, and it took a lot of trial and error to discover that he loves chicken far more than tuna or salmon.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-auto text-lg text-center text-gray-400 lg:text-2xl lg:text-left md:text-sm">
      At first, I used a simple Excel sheet to track Aji's meals, hoping to find a pattern. I quickly noticed that if I gave him something he didn't like, he would skip the meal entirely and walk away.
    </p>

    <p class="mx-auto text-lg text-center text-gray-400 lg:text-2xl lg:text-left md:text-sm">
      But using Excel for daily manual entry was tedious, and visualizing trends was a challenge. That's why I created Aji Tracker: to easily visualize feeding trends over time and organize Aji's favorite foods, ensuring he stays well-fed and happy every day.
