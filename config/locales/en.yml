    title: "The Story Behind Aji Tracker"
    paragraph_1: "This app was inspired by my first cat, Aji, a ginger and white furball with a surprisingly particular taste. Unlike most ginger cats, Aji has his own unique preferences, and it took a lot of trial and error to discover that he loves chicken far more than tuna or salmon."
    paragraph_2: "At first, I used a simple Excel sheet to track Aji's meals, hoping to find a pattern. I quickly noticed that if I gave him something he didn't like, he would skip the meal entirely and walk away."
    paragraph_3: "But using Excel for daily manual entry was tedious, and visualizing trends was a challenge. That's why I created Aji Tracker: to easily visualize eating trends over time and organize Aji's favorite foods, ensuring he stays well-fed and happy every day."
    paragraph_4: "✨ Ready to give it a try? Sign up and see for yourself."
    paragraph_5: "If you're interested in learning more about cat eating habits, I highly recommend consulting a professional. I personally found great insights from"
